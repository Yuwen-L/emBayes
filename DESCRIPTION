Description: Various variable selection methods have been developed from frequentist and Bayesian perspectives. However, current Bayesian Spike-and-slab LASSO method lack robustness. In this package, we provide the implementation of Spike-and-slab quantile LASSO (BQLSS). It is a variable selection and estimation method that is constructed by extending the spike-and slab LASSO method to Bayesian quantile regression. It combines the advantages of Bayesian spike-and-slab prior and frequentist LASSO penalty function while maintaining robustness. Alternative method Bayesian linear regression with spike-and-slab LASSO prior (BLSS) is also included. The core modules of the package have been developed in C++.
